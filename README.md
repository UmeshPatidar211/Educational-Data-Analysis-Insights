# 🎓 Educational Data Analysis & Insights

This project focuses on **cleaning, analyzing, and extracting insights** from the *Student Exam Scores* dataset.  
The goal is to understand how various factors like **parent education, gender, study habits, sports activity, and demographics** influence student academic performance.

## 📁 Dataset Source
**Kaggle Dataset:**  
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desalegngeb/students-exam-scores

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Clean the dataset and fix data quality issues
- Explore key relationships between student background & performance
- Identify influential factors affecting academic scores
- Build a structured report ready for **portfolio, internship, or academic submission**

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process
✔ Removed unnecessary columns (`Unnamed: 0`)  
✔ Handled missing values (Mode & Median)  
✔ Corrected datatypes and categorical inconsistencies  
✔ Converted `"none"` → `"incomplete"` in TestPrep column  
✔ Verified duplicates (none found)  
✔ Dataset Exported as `Cleaned_Dataset.csv`

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Findings:
| Feature | Insight |
|---------|----------|
| **Parent Education** | Higher education → Higher student marks |
| **Gender** | Balanced distribution (Equal opportunity for analysis) |
| **Ethnic Groups** | Groups C & D dominate (60%+) |
| **Sports Activity** | Mostly "sometimes" → irregular participation |
| **Subject Scores** | Reading/Writing highest, Math lowest |

### Performance Summary:
- 📘 Reading: **~69**
- ✍️ Writing: **~68**
- 🔢 Math: **~66** *(lowest average)*
